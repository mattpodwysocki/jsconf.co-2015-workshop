# Observables with AND and OR logic

In the previous exercises, we looked at creating a computation of the Body Mass Index with a `combineLatest` to combine both the height and the width as they changed to calculate the result.  In this set of exercises, we will take this one step further to combine both height1 and height2 to calculate the BMI.  Just a hint that `merge` here is your friend to combine Observables.

As always, for more information about Observables, check out the [RxJS Documentation](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/tree/master/doc/readme.md)
