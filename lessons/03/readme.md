# Reactive Programming Fundamentals

In this lesson you will learn about the basics of Observables with the Reactive Extensions. With Arrays in the previous examples, these were "pull" collections, but in the reactive world, they are "push" based. We will take the example from the previous exercise and turn it into a Observable sequence.  For more information about Observables, check out the [RxJS Documentation](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/tree/master/doc/readme.md)
