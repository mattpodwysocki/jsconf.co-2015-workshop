# Combining Two Orthogonal Observables

Combining Observables is a way of life and there are many ways to do it. In the previous exercise, we showed how you could combine two mousemouse events via `zip`, but there are other ways such as `combineLatest` which combines the latest value from each Observable into a new Observable.

As always, for more information about Observables, check out the [RxJS Documentation](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/tree/master/doc/readme.md)
